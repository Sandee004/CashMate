# CashMate
CashMate is a dummy finance based web app. Upon sign up you get a virtual card for carrying out transactions. You can also see expenses made every week/month in form of charts. You have $69,000 which can be spent and each transaction is shown on the transactions tab

I made use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the frontend and Flask(Python) for backend. I learnt how to create charts, bar codes and QR codes using JavaScript. Made use of Ajax at some point.
